 # :volcano: Save Pompeii! :cityscape:
 

## Introduction 

Save Pompeii operates the same as the classic game Hangman except in this version you are trying to save the city of Pompeii from the Mt. Vesuvius erruption. 

The volcano is errupting and it's up to you to save Pompeii! Guess letters to complete the chosen word but beware, the more incorrect guesses a player has, the closer the lava gets to the city. :pleading_face:

## Prerequisites

* Save Pompeii is not mobile optimized and operates best on Google's Chrome desktop browser.

## Installation

To install Save Pompeii, download all repository files to your computer. Be sure to save them in the same directory (aka folder).

Open index.html in Chrome and play!

## Playing a Game

To begin, click the Start Game button. 

At the first screen, one player enters a word, a maximum number of guesses (optional), and a time limit (optional). 

On the following screen, another player uses their keyboard or the UI keyboard to guess letters until they guess the word, their chances are exhausted, or time runs out.
